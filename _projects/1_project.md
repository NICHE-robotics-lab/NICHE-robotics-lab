SQUEEZE is a deformable, compliant quadrotor with passively morphing arms, designed using torsional spring hinges that allow the arms to deflect under external forces. This enables the vehicle to adapt its geometry mid-flight for navigating constrained environments leveraging collisions. {% cite patnaik2020design %}
