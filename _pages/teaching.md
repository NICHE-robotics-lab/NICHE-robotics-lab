üìö <strong style="color:#6f42c1;">Welcome to my Teaching Page</strong>  
I'm deeply passionate about education, and below is a curated overview of the courses and sessions I‚Äôve designed and delivered‚Äîfrom high school outreach to graduate-level instruction. My teaching philosophy emphasizes <strong>hands-on experimentation</strong>, <strong>inclusive learning environments</strong>, and building strong theoretical foundations for real-world <strong>robotic systems</strong>.
