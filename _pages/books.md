> Books are time machines made of paper—silent, unassuming, yet brimming with voices. As I read, I find myself in dialogue with minds from different centuries, wrestling with evolution, governance, and justice. Whether unpacking the layered history in India After Gandhi or experiencing the surreal beauty of Story of Your Life and Others, I read not just to escape—but to uncover.
> As Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” Reading helps me confront that unconscious, question assumptions, and trace the invisible threads between history, science, and self.
> Books break the shackles of time. And sometimes, they break the shackles of who we think we are.
