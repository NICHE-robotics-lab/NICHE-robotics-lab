The NICHE Robotic Systems Laboratory, led by Dr. Karishma Patnaik at the University of Michigan–Dearborn, builds robotic systems that interact with the world through purposeful contact. We specialize in applied control for hybrid environments — from aerial to ground, compliant to rigid — where interaction is not just tolerated, but leveraged.

Our work blends planning, dynamics, and real-world constraints to design systems that are resilient, adaptive, and deployable. We take inspiration from nature, but build for high-stakes applications in manufacturing, inspection, and exploration.

💡 <strong style="color:#6f42c1;">Trivia on Logo</strong>:  
The stylized <span style="color:#d63384;"><strong>hummingbird</strong></span> to the right, constructed through <em>Fourier harmonic synthesis</em> of a real contour, embodies the essence of our lab — where <strong>mathematical elegance</strong> meets <strong>physical adaptability</strong>.

Like the hummingbird, our systems are <span style="color:#6f42c1;"><strong>light, agile, and resilient</strong></span>, navigating hybrid environments with purpose and precision. Each harmonic reflects the <em>layered complexity of robotic interaction</em>: from fine-grained control to broader behavioral patterns.

The bird’s balance around the coordinate origin echoes our lab’s commitment to <strong>centered, nature-inspired control</strong> in contact-rich tasks.
